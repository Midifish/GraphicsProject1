NOTE: 
Loading textures remotely in Chrome is a pain in the butt in Three.js, therefore I have opted to use 
a website shortcut to my github-hosted project to ensure Chrome support. I have approval from Dr. Watson to do this
instead of the index.html file. You may verify my code at https://github.com/midifish/midifish.github.io and
you can run the game locally if you open index.html in Firefox. Thank you and enjoy the game!
